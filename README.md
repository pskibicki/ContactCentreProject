## How much time did you spend?
12h

## How can we build your solution and run unit tests?
Run via Visual Studio.
You can use docker or local IIS - it's web API so it has to be hosted.
Test run in Visual Studio or via command dotnet test.

## What technologies / libraries / programming paradigms have you chosen? Why?
 - Web API in .NET Core (.NET 5),
 - Swagger UI as presentation layer,
 - AutoMapper,
 - xUnit and Moq for tests,

## Have you done any modeling / planning before coding? Please share that with us :)
I started this project by thinking how to model data, so it can be extendable in the future.
My initial plan was way simplier, but during coding I decided to introduce more models for better domain representation.
